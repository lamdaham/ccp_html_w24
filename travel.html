                Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, is a large city known for ornate shrines and vibrant street life.
                It is officially known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon and colloquially as Krung Thep.
            </p>

                Bangkok welcomes more visitors than any other city in the world and it doesn’t take long to realize why.
                Bangkok is a city of contrasts with action at every turn. Marvel at the gleaming temples, catch a tuk-tuk
                through bustling Chinatown, or take a longtail boat through floating markets. Food is another Bangkok highlight,
                from local dishes served at humble street stalls to haute cuisine at romantic rooftop restaurants.
